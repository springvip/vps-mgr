# VPS Manager

A single-file Bash TUI for managing Debian/Ubuntu servers: kernel tuning, firewall hardening, proxy service deployment, port forwarding, traffic accounting, and Telegram-based monitoring.

All configuration is entered interactively at runtime. No credentials are stored in this repository.

## Requirements

- Debian / Ubuntu (uses `apt`)
- systemd
- root privileges

## Usage

```bash
wget -O vps-mgr.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/springvip/vps-mgr/main/vps-mgr.sh
chmod +x vps-mgr.sh
sudo ./vps-mgr.sh
```

The script is menu-driven — run it and pick an option.
